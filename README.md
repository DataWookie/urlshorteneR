[Managing projects in the Google Developers' Console](https://developers.google.com/console/help/new/)

Read the [high level overview](https://developers.google.com/url-shortener/v1/getting_started) of Google's URL shortener API, more details can be found in the [API documentation](https://developers.google.com/url-shortener/v1/).

[Using OAuth 2.0 for Installed Applications](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2InstalledApp)

The [longurl](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/longurl/) package will expand URLs from a range of URL shortening services. There is a surprisingly large number of these services (check out the [list](http://api.longurl.org/v2/services)). I tried this package and it does a great job of expanding shortened URLs. It does not provide a shortening service though or access to analytics.
